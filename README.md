## Eurorack module prototyping boards

A range of boards to aid the design and construction of Eurorack modules - inspired by the 'perma proto-boards' offered by the likes of AdaFruit et.al.

Three sizes are offered:

- `small` is roughly equivalent to a mini 170pt breadboard. However, unlike mini breadboards, these do have power rails (see below). Overall size is 57.2 x 64mm
- `medium` is equivalent to a half-size (400pt) breadboard. Overall size is 60.4 x 94.7mm
- `large` is equivalent to a full-size (800pt) breadboard. Note that this is far too large to be fitted in a typical Eurorack case although it could be used for 'desktop' style modules. Users of other formats may find it useful too. Overall size is 60.4 x 171.4mm.

These boards differ from 'traditional' prototyping boards in a couple of ways:

- They have three power rails, rather than two. One for +12V, one for -12V and one for ground.
- There are M3 mounting holes at each corner.
- There are an additional couple of ground rails at the top of the board.
- Power is provided by a 10-pin Eurorack power header.

Electrically, the rows of 5 pads are connected in the same way as a 'traditional' breadboard. I am planning to make pad-per-hole versions of these boards 
available in the near future.
